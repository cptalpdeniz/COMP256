Lab 01:
Problem 1: 
Write a function that receives a string containing a 16-bit binary integer. The function must return the string's integer value.

Problem 2: 
Write a function that receives a string containing a 32-bit hexadecimal integer. The function must return the string's integer value.
	
Problem 3: 
Write a function that receives an integer. The function must return a string containing the binary representation of the integer.

Problem 4: 
Write a function that receives an integer. The function must return a string containing the hexadecimal representation of the integer.

Problem 5: 
Write a function that adds two digit-strings in base b, where 2 <= b <= 10. Each string may be as long as one million digits, and strings must be of equal length. 
Return the sum in a string that uses the same number base.
